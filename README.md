# simulation_practice

Since I am new to climate physics, chaos and nonlinear dynamics, I will be practicing some mathematics-based simulations. This repository will be (I expect) for simple oceanic models, and perhaps Lorenz-based dynamics. I would love to also make some animations, and explore how easily that can fit into a README, or whether I should link it. Here are a few ideas of things I could model:
- convection of the MOC, AMOC specifically, showing density and temperature dynamics for its circulation
- energy flux between ocean and atmosphere
- eddies
